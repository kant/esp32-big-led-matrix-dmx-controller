Bottleneck:
That said, your biggest issue is going to be voltage drop on the strip, and that will depend on how bright you're
running the LEDs and how many are on simultaneously. You can always inject power along the strip in segments with heavy
cable from a large PSU, or via several "point of load" power supplies. Just make sure to keep a common ground connection

With the WS2812B and similar LEDs, the data signal itself is regenerated by each LED chip, so that isn't generally an issue.

With enough LEDs, your next bottleneck will be either memory capacity of your microcontroller, or the time to send each
data frame (depending on your desired update rate).

Things: - the amount of Ram of the ESP32

Ideas:
SRAM usage:
- each LED uses 3bytes of your SRAM
- The sRAM is also used of DMX and Network.

ESPWROOM 32: 512KBytes of sRAM
   --> Esp supports 4x 16mBytes of external QSPI flash and SRAM
